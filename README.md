# 🎓 Student Performance Data Analysis

## 📖 Overview
This project simulates and analyzes student performance data using Python.  
It generates two synthetic datasets representing different groups of students, each with details about:
- Student number  
- Age  
- Average study hours  
- Marks achieved  
- Time taken during exams  

The program explores frequency distributions and relationships between these variables through visualizations.

## 🧩 Features
- Automatically generates random student datasets (`dataset1.csv` and `dataset2.csv`)
- Cleans the data by removing invalid entries
- Creates frequency tables for:
  - Study hours
  - Student age
  - Student marks
- Produces multiple visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
  - Bar charts for frequency comparisons  
  - Scatter plots and line graphs for correlations  

## 📊 Insights
- Relationship between student age and time spent studying  
- Correlation between higher marks and exam duration  
- Comparison between two simulated datasets  

## ⚙️ Installation
